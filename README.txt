The full code of the statistical analysis is included in the repository folder.
It is composed of 5 R scripts and the .stan file containing the model specification in C++ to be compiled in Stan.

Each script requires input files and produces output files.
Both are well described in the comments of the script and all files can be found in "Data" folder.
When the outputs are figures, these are saved and stored in "Figures" folder.

Each script will produce outputs to be used as input files in the next script, according to the ordering number
on the name of the R files.

R version used: 3.6.1
